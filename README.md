# trello-sorter-powerup

## Overview

Sort trello cards by assigned members!!!

## Installation
This code should be registered as a trello power-ups. For those who do not know what the trello power-ups is, please refer to [link](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/trello/)

I followed [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FW2X1CXrU1w&t=163s) for quick developement and installation. I think you can follow this too~!

I wish It would be public power-ups...

### Upload to CDN
You can use whatever CDN publisher you want. I prefer netlify for simple deployment in this case. Please refer [netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)
